## About

This project implements a complete solution for task management using JWT authentication and secure registration/login for users. It is designed to work with a backend server that stores user data in a database, ensuring security and smooth communication.

The frontend application communicates with the backend API to register users, handle authentication with JWT tokens, and manage tasks (creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks). It provides a user-friendly dashboard for task management.
